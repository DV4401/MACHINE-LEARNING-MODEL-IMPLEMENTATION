This Jupyter Notebook implements a spam email detection model using Scikit-learn. It creates a synthetic dataset of 10 emails (spam and ham), preprocesses the text with TF-IDF vectorization, and trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The notebook evaluates the model with accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix heatmap, then tests it on new email examples. It includes markdown explanations and code cells for data creation, training, evaluation, and prediction.
